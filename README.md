# TensorFlow Practice

This repository contains a collection of practice scripts and notebooks created while learning and experimenting with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Purpose

The goal of this work is to:
- Explore TensorFlow's core features and APIs
- Understand the basics of building and training machine learning models
- Get comfortable with TensorFlow workflows using Python
- Test and debug simple models and operations

## Contents

You may find:
- Sample classification and regression tasks
- Tensor operations and basic neural network structures
- Notes and code snippets for future reference

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need:
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow (recommended version: 2.x)
- NumPy and other common ML libraries

You can install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
